# Image-to-text-chrome-extension
A chrome extension which can recognize any type of text in your browser from any video or image using the concept of OCR. OCR is short form of Optical Character Recognition or in other word finding text in images. Google had previously released a engine called tesseract OCR, this means that google provides you with a program that has text recognition already trained into it, so I donâ€™t have to do complicated things like training the data in OCR myself. Now for the function of our extension it first takes screenshot from the current opened tab, then crop the desired part using canvas and adjust it using threshold binarization so that it can fill OCR requirements to give more accurate results. Then send it to pytesseract so it can convert it and download the text in .txt file format. At the end get the text and download it in .txt file format.
